# The Happy World of HARIBO
*Haribo makes millions of gummies every day to ensure that everyone can experience our
happy world of Haribo at any time. But no matter how large-scale our operations may get, 
we will always be dedicated to fulfilling the following standards with every individual treat.*

**1. Every gummy is guaranteed to be of the highest quality**

Producing high quality treats is our top priority here at Haribo. 
We only use the best and freshest raw materials in our production, which means that every incoming ingredient is 
thoroughly checked and analyzed before ever going into production. In turn, every step in the 
production process is strictly monitored to comply with all health and safety standards. 
In fact, HARIBO is certified in accordance with FSSC 22000 – a food safety standard that goes 
far beyond the legal requirements.

**2. Our gummies are the result of creativity coming to life** 

The Haribo Team is constantly working on creating new shapes and flavors for our gummies. 
Every Gold Bear, Twin Snake, or Happy Cola that you find yourself reaching towards
started with a single idea. That idea was sketched on paper and re sketched; molded and 
remolded, until the shape was finally perfected. Every flavor that you love has been 
carefully crafted to ensure deliciousness. Every iteration tested by our experts to
maintain the iconic image of the haribo gummy that started it all.


**3. ”Kids and grown ups love it so, the happy world of Haribo”**

Since the founding of our brand in 1920, Haribo has been a family-run business. A such, we are 
committed to inspiring moments of childlike happiness in children and adults alike. 
In the dozens of different products that we distribute all over the world, there will always 
be something for everyone to enjoy.
